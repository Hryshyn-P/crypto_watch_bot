- trading pair, for example: **BNBBTC**
- several trading pairs space separated, for example: **BNBBTC ETHBTC**
- ###### By default, each an unpaired symbol (input less than 5 characters long) will show a course to **BUSD**, for exaple: **ETC ---> ETCBUSD**
***************************
- Use command */num* to change the length of the price for readability, for example, with a large number of characters after the dot, so that part of the string of a particular character is not carried over to the next line. For example: */num 5* - will shorten the length to 5 characters. Valid range is from 1 to 14 characters. After completely stopping the bot, or using the */stop* command, the length is reset to the default 14 characters.
- Use command */symbols* to see a list of all available symbols on the Binance spot market at the moment.
